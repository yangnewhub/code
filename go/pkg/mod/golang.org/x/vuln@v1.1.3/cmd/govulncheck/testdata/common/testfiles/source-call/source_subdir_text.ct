# Test govulncheck runs on the subdirectory of a module
$ govulncheck -C ${moddir}/vuln/subdir . --> FAIL 3
=== Symbol Results ===

Vulnerability #1: GO-2021-0113
    Due to improper index calculation, an incorrectly formatted language tag can
    cause Parse to panic via an out of bounds read. If Parse is used to process
    untrusted user inputs, this may be used as a vector for a denial of service
    attack.
